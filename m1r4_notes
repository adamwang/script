* Fped notes:
so the complete sequence for creating a new frame and then adding things to it is:
1) "Add frame" on the left side
2) edit the name of the new frame (default name "_")
3) select the parent frame
4) drag the new frame (click and hold the name, then drag it into the canvas) to its starting location
5) select the new frame (on the left side again)
6) so to the canvas and add the things you want there, starting from the frame's origin

note that a frame can have multiple parents. e.g., if you have a vector (10, 0) and a vector (-10, 0) in the root frame, you can attach "marker" (or some other frame) to each vectors

last but not least, the place where you attach a frame is the end of a vector in the parent frame or the parent frame's origin. so you don't have to make a vector (0, 0) to connect something to the origin

if you don't attach the frame, then the screen stays dark :)
