* Fped notes:
so the complete sequence for creating a new frame and then adding things to it is:
1) "Add frame" on the left side
2) edit the name of the new frame (default name "_")
3) select the parent frame
4) drag the new frame (click and hold the name, then drag it into the canvas) to its starting location
5) select the new frame (on the left side again)
6) so to the canvas and add the things you want there, starting from the frame's origin
note that a frame can have multiple parents. e.g., if you have a vector (10, 0) and a vector (-10, 0) in the root frame, you can attach "marker" (or some other frame) to each vectors
